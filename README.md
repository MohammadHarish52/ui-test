## Introduction
This project is a showcase of a simple UI design implemented using React and SCSS. 
I had to replicate this Figma design  https://www.figma.com/file/5aLPCUKLWbxISQReS6dHsu/NextJs%2FReactJs-Assignment?type=design&node-id=601-10&mode=design&t=yqfcGDK2PQX9CWig-0

## Usage
Once the project is running locally, you can interact with the UI to see its functionality and compare it with the original design .
